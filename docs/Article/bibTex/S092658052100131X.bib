abstract = {This study developed a formwork automation design software that interprets 3D building information modeling (BIM) data from the 2D CAD data of a target structure. This software aimed to identify the quantity and types of formworks and situations that may occur at construction sites. A prototype that can implement 3D automation design, automatic formwork layout, and statistics function was developed for simple target structures; this confirmed the possibility of developing the software, for which a preliminary study was conducted to convert random vertices in the BIM data of the target structure to forms with certain rules. The meshes were transformed into a constant form using an algorithm that fills a 3D model with identical square meshes. Additionally, an algorithm was developed by setting and prioritizing specific rules for the faces. The software operation result confirmed the possibility of automatic formwork layout of wall and deck members.}
