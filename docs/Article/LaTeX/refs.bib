abstract = {Construction automation has shown the potential to increase construction productivity after years of technical development and experimenting in its field. Exactly how, and the possible benefits and challenges of construction automation, though is unclear and missing from current research efforts. In order to better understand the comprehensive potential of construction automation for increasing construction productivity and the associated possible ramifications, an objective and data-driven review of the use of automation technologies in construction was done. The review was accomplished by using text mining methods on publically available written documents, covering a wide range of relevant data including scientific publications and social media. The text mining software VOS Viewer and RapidMiner Studio were used to determine the most promising areas of research through the analysis of scientific publications, and the main areas of concern of industry through the analysis of text on social media, respectively. These research areas and concerns are summarized in this paper, and based on them suggestions for industry are made to help advance the uptake of automation in construction.}

abstract = {This study developed a formwork automation design software that interprets 3D building information modeling (BIM) data from the 2D CAD data of a target structure. This software aimed to identify the quantity and types of formworks and situations that may occur at construction sites. A prototype that can implement 3D automation design, automatic formwork layout, and statistics function was developed for simple target structures; this confirmed the possibility of developing the software, for which a preliminary study was conducted to convert random vertices in the BIM data of the target structure to forms with certain rules. The meshes were transformed into a constant form using an algorithm that fills a 3D model with identical square meshes. Additionally, an algorithm was developed by setting and prioritizing specific rules for the faces. The software operation result confirmed the possibility of automatic formwork layout of wall and deck members.}

abstract = {The construction industry is known to be overwhelmed with resource planning, risk management and logistic challenges which often result in design defects, project delivery delays, cost overruns and contractual disputes. These challenges have instigated research in the application of advanced machine learning algorithms such as deep learning to help with diagnostic and prescriptive analysis of causes and preventive measures. However, the publicity created by tech firms like Google, Facebook and Amazon about Artificial Intelligence and applications to unstructured data is not the end of the field. There abound many applications of deep learning, particularly within the construction sector in areas such as site planning and management, health and safety and construction cost prediction, which are yet to be explored. The overall aim of this article was to review existing studies that have applied deep learning to prevalent construction challenges like structural health monitoring, construction site safety, building occupancy modelling and energy demand prediction. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no extensive survey of the applications of deep learning techniques within the construction industry. This review would inspire future research into how best to apply image processing, computer vision, natural language processing techniques of deep learning to numerous challenges in the industry. Limitations of deep learning such as the black box challenge, ethics and GDPR, cybersecurity and cost, that can be expected by construction researchers and practitioners when adopting some of these techniques were also discussed.}

abstract = {Automation and robotics technology is expected to improve the productivity of the construction industry as well as to solve problems such as labor shortage and safety risks, especially for high-rise buildings. Substantial research efforts have been devoted to the field over the past decades, while the application rate at the construction sites is still limited. Although various reviews have summarized the research topics and future trends in this field, few research efforts have been made on a consideration of both academic research and practical application in the industry. Focusing on high-rise building construction, this study explores the development of both academic research and practical application of automation and robotics based on literature and market review. Scientometric and critical literature reviews were conducted to identify and analyze the development of key research areas based on academic publications from the 1980s to present. In the meantime, the development of basic technologies was summarized. The market review surveyed on existing products and developers of construction automation and robotics. By comparing the results of the literature review and market review, four development patterns of academic research and product application were identified, i.e., simultaneous development led by the same party, development at a similar pace with the two sides taking the lead in different aspects, academic research providing basic technologies for product development, and available technologies in academic research with no products found. Then three gaps in this field, i.e., the gap between academic research and products, the gap between products and application, and the gap between the construction industry and the robotics industry, were discussed with corresponding suggestions to narrow the gaps, followed by an outlook for future directions. This study contributes to the knowledge body by identifying and analyzing the key research areas and the development gaps systematically.}

abstract = {The following article reviews past and current tendencies and derives and describes opportunities for future construction automation that go beyond the current notion of construction automation. Various indicators suggest that conventional construction methodology has reached its limits. An overlay of S-curves can be used to describe the relationship between the stagnation and technical limits of conventional construction and the initiation, development, and growth of new strategies and technologies of construction automation. Although approaches of construction automation are still in an innovation or seed phase, it can be expected that with continued effort put into research and development these approaches may soon enter into the growth phase and encounter adoption on a larger scale. Furthermore, the article shows that over time, the ability of robot systems has grown, allowing them to work more and more in comparably unstructured environments as well as to be deployed in numerous and diverse fields. Currently, it can already be observed that construction automation technology, STCR approaches, service robot systems, and other microsystems technology are merging with the built environment, becoming inherent elements of buildings, building components, and building furniture.}

abstract = {Building Information Modelling (BIM) and off-site construction (OSC) are increasingly applied in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry due to their many benefits to project stakeholders, such as enhanced design visualization, improved data exchanges, reduced construction waste, improved productivity, and higher product quality. Substantial research efforts have thus been devoted to these topics in recent decades, resulting in a large amount of literature regarding BIM and OSC. This research explores the state-of-the-art in BIM for OSC by means of a bibliometric-qualitative review method. The objective of this research is to uncover the synthesis between BIM and OSC and to identify research trends as well as gaps in knowledge that can be addressed in future research on BIM for OSC. Science maps are constructed by means of bibliometric analysis in order to objectively identify the main research topics of these two fields both separately and jointly based on identified academic publications from Scopus (i.e., 4395 publications on BIM, 2841 publications on OSC, and 113 publications on BIM for OSC). A qualitative review is further conducted on 77 screened research publications (including articles, reviews, conference papers) with a particular focus on BIM for OSC. Through quantitative analysis and in-depth discussion of BIM for OSC, research gaps are identified, and future directions are further proposed as follows: BIM-based generative design for prefabrication, cloud BIM-based data exchange for OSC, robotics and 3D printing for OSC, BIM-enabled big data analytics toward best OSC practice, benefits and its assessment model of BIM for OSC. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by synthesizing the state of the art of BIM for OSC and exposing the research needs in this area in order to improve AEC practice.}
