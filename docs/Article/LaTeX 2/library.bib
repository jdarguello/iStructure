abstract = {A review of the many uses of matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) in the extraction and analysis of a variety of compounds from a range of samples is provided. Matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) has found particular application as a somewhat generic analytical process for the preparation, extraction and fractionation of solid, semi-solid and/or highly viscous biological samples. Its simplicity and flexibility contribute to it being chosen over more classical methods for these purposes. MSPD is based on several simple principles of chemistry and physics, involving forces applied to the sample by mechanical blending to produce complete sample disruption and the interactions of the sample matrix with a solid support bonded-phase (SPE) or the surface chemistry of other solid support materials. These principles are discussed as are the factors to be considered in conducting a MSPD extraction. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The differences between ultrasonic and non-ultrasonic approaches in synthesizing Lignosus rhinocerotis polysaccharide-selenium nanoparticles (LRP-SeNPs) were compared in terms of size, morphology, stability and antioxidant activity by UV-VIS, FT-IR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) with high resolution TEM. Results indicated that the SeNPs were associated with the LRP macromolecules in a physical adsorption pattern without breaking chemical bonds, and the ultrasonic treatment reduced the size of SeNPs, narrowed the size distribution as well as improved the stability. Due to the LRP compact coil structure loosed under ultrasonic cavitation, the SeNPs could be easily diffused into the LRP internal branches instead of gathering on the LRP surface and were well dispersed and eventually stabilized throughout the extended branches. After ultrasound treatment, the SeNPs had a minimum average diameter of ∼50 nm and the LRP-SeNPs could remain homogeneous and translucent for 16 days within 200 nm size. Furthermore, the ultrasound-treated LRP-SeNPs exhibited higher DPPH and ABTS radical-scavenging abilities than those untreated with ultrasound. This difference may be attributed to the reason that ultrasound can reduce the SeNPs size and increase the specific surface area, which provides sufficient active sites to react with the free radicals and suppress the oxidizing reactions. The integrated results demonstrated that ultrasound played a crucial role in the dispersion, size control, stabilization and antioxidant activity of SeNPs.},

abstract = {The extraction efficiency of bioactive compounds along with their biological activity and stability depends on the extraction temperature and time. The effects of extraction temperature (60–90 °C) and time (15–180 min) on the total soluble solids (TSS) content, antioxidant activity, and curcuminoids of aqueous turmeric extracts were studied. The stability of extracts based on curcuminoid degradation, loss of antioxidant activity and color was also investigated by further heat treatment at 90 °C and 25 °C for 48 h. The TSS showed temperature dependency, reached a maximum value within 60 min and then plateaued for all temperatures. The maximum TSS and curcuminoid concentration were obtained at an extraction temperature and time of 90 °C and 60 min, respectively. Antioxidant activity increased with both increasing temperature and time. After infusing the extracts at 90 °C for 1 h followed by separation, further heat treatment at 90 °C for 48 h resulted in curcuminoid degradation and reduced antioxidant activity while no changes were observed in extracts kept at 25 °C for the same time. High extraction temperature for appropriate time results in high TSS and high antioxidant activity. However, excessive heat treatment led to the degradation of curcuminoids and reductions in antioxidant activity.},

Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI-TOF), Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed a modification in the chemical structure of these macromolecules treated by US and, particularly, bath US produced a considerable increase of up to 49, 41 and 35{\%}, respectively, of catechins and oligomeric and polymeric procyanidin contents of the treated purified fraction. Bath US also produced an important increase in the number of procyanidins with higher molecular mass (up to decamers) and an overall increase in the mass signal intensities in most of the detected B-type procyanidin series, as well as an important increase of the antioxidant activity of the macromolecular fraction of procyanidins. These results could be ascribed to a certain disaggregation of procyanidins linked to other biopolymers, such as proteins and/or polysaccharides, indicating that US is an efficient technology to modify the chemical structure and hence the bioactivity of tannins.},

The latter may be characterised by a single parameter based on an adaptation of Von Rittinger's constant.A relation characterising wood pellet energy consumption as a function of the particle size distribution of the pellet ingredients and the milled pellets is proposed.

abstract = {The objective of this review is to provide updated information about the most important features of the new solid-phase extraction (SPE) materials, their interaction mode and their potential for modern SPE. First, the recent developments are given in formats, phases, automation, high throughput purpose and set-up of new types of procedures. Emphasis is then placed on the large choice of sorbents for trapping analytes over a wide range of polarities, such as highly cross-linked copolymers, functionalized copolymers, graphitized carbons or some specific n-alkylsilicas. The method development is given which is based on prediction from liquid chromatographic retention data or solvation parameters in order to determine the main parameters of any sequence (type and amount of sorbent, sample volume which can be applied without loss of recovery, composition and volume of the clean-up solution, composition and volume of the desorption solution). Obtaining extracts free from matrix interferences in a few steps – one step when possible – is now included in the development of SPE procedure. New selective phases such as mixed-mode and restricted access matrix sorbents or emerging phases such as immunosorbents or molecularly imprinted polymers are reviewed. Selectivity obtained by combining two sorbents is described with the use of ion-exchange or ion-pair sorbents. Special attention is given to complete automation of the SPE sequence with its on-line coupling with liquid chromatography followed by various detection modes. This represents a fast, modern and reliable approach to trace analysis. Many examples illustrate the various features of modern SPE which are discussed in this review. They have been selected in both biological and environmental areas},

In order to better understand the comprehensive potential of construction automation for increasing construction productivity and the associated possible ramifications, an objective and data-driven review of the use of automation technologies in construction was done. The review was accomplished by using text mining methods on publically available written documents, covering a wide range of relevant data including scientific publications and social media. The text mining software VOS Viewer and RapidMiner Studio were used to determine the most promising areas of research through the analysis of scientific publications, and the main areas of concern of industry through the analysis of text on social media, respectively. These research areas and concerns are summarized in this paper, and based on them suggestions for industry are made to help advance the uptake of automation in construction.},

abstract = {Measuring productivity growth in construction has been a classic challenge, largely because reliable output deflators are scarce. This paper reports first results from a Bureau of Labor Statistics research group convened to measure construction productivity better. Results show that labor productivity growth has been positive, and fairly substantial, in all four industries where reliable deflators now exist. Shifts of labor between construction industries reduce productivity growth by 0.4{\%} a year. Regulation is a significant negative effect on productivity, but reduces productivity growth by only 0.1{\%} a year. Undocumented immigrants are important in construction, and often work off the books, but reasonable allowance for their increased presence reduces productivity growth by only 0.1{\%} a year. The influences examined are not sufficient to explain why productivity growth is so much lower in construction than elsewhere. Later work will measure productivity growth in a broader range of industries, including some industries representing contractors. However, this further work requires access to restricted Census microdata, and so will take several years more to complete.},

abstract = {The energy requirement is a key criterion for the selection and use of a grinding process. Ultrasonic dispersion is extensively used to disperse submicron agglomerated powders in liquid suspensions. Suspensions of silica agglomerates were ground with solids concentration up to 50{\%} by weight. The fragmentation or grinding rate is inversely proportional to suspension volume. Starting from a semiempirical expression that relates fragmentation rate to particle size, suspension volume and ultrasonic power, energy consumption laws for both eroding and non-eroding powders are developed. Experimental results supporting the energy consumption laws are given. Lower power input for ultrasonication favors efficient energy use. For eroding powders (e.g. silica, zirconia) the energy expenditure per unit powder mass (specific energy) by ultrasonic grinding is lower than that of conventional grinding techniques. In contrast, it is slightly higher than ball milling for non-eroding powders (e.g. titania).},

abstract = {Biomass raw materials are widely regarded as a significant source of renewable energy, which significantly reduces the dependence on traditional fossil fuels, especially in the case of countries that are able to obtain biomass from various sources. Recently, pelletization has been widely used for mass and energy densification of biomass to overcome the problems associated with raw material use. As the global pellet market has developed quickly, the use of wood residues became no longer sufficient to fulfill the market needs. The standards of pellets provide limits for both physical and mechanical characteristics of produced pellets. Characteristics of produced pellets depend mainly on the feedstock characteristics as particle size and moisture content and operating conditions as applied pressure and die temperature. Thus, this paper provides rich information on the factors affecting the physical and mechanical properties of granules included in pellets. The main goal of the paper is to review the latest and comprehensive research on the physical and mechanical properties of most types of single and mixed pellets from biomass. The analysis of the effect of properties, adhesives, humidity, pressure and temperature as well as the physical and mechanical properties of the pellets studied was carried out. In addition, the critical and optimal values of various factors for different materials in which the following is of importance: high quality of pellets and biomass from which they are produced were analyzed. The principle and effect of applying post-production conditions as steam explosion and torrefaction on the characteristics of the pellets were reviewed in details. Moreover, this study proposes some recommendations for further development of the pelletization analysis and characteristics.},

abstract = {Prediction of continuous steady-state ball milling using the traditional population balance model requires knowledge of several functions, namely those describing the rate and distribution of breakage products, the mass transfer relationship between the mill hold-up and the discharge, the mode of transport within the mill, as well as the description of internal classification, whenever present. In spite of its long track record, there are comparatively few instances in which the population balance model of continuous ball milling has been validated in great detail under controlled conditions. The work analyzes how confidently one can predict continuous milling in a dry open-circuit pilot-scale operating under a wide range of feed rates, mill speeds, fillings and feed materials (an iron ore and a spent catalyst) using the population balance model. It relies on measured residence time distribution of the solids, the Austin model of grinding and the expressions recently proposed by Nomura to describe mass transfer from the mill to the discharge to predict continuous grinding. Breakage parameters of the materials studied were estimated on the basis of batch grinding tests. Parameters in Nomura's transport model were fitted on the basis of a few selected continuous tests and were used to estimate the mill hold up operating under a range of conditions.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 by the Endocrine Society. Enteroendocrine (EEC) cells have a pivotal role in intestinal nutrient sensing and release hormones that orchestrate food digestion and regulate appetite. EEC cells are found scattered throughout the intestine and have typically been classified based on the primary hormone they contain. I cells represent a subset of EEC cells that secrete cholecystokinin (CCK) and are mainly localized to the duodenum. Recent studies have shown that I cells express mRNAs encoding several gut hormones. In this stud y, we investigated the hormonal profile of murine fluorescence-activated cell sortingsorted duodenal I cells using semiquantitative RT-PCR, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, and immunostaining methods. We report that I cells are enriched in mRNA transcripts encoding CCK and also other key gut hormones, including neurotensin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), secretin, peptide YY, proglucagon, and ghrelin (Ghrl). Furthermore, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis of fluorescence-activated cell sortingpurified I cells and immunostaining confirmed the presence of these gut hormones in duodenal I cells. Immunostaining highlighted that subsets of I cells in both crypts and villi coexpress differential amounts of CCK, Ghrl, GIP, or peptide YY, indicating that a proportion of I cells contain several hormones during maturation and when fully differentiated. Our results reveal that although I cells express several key gut hormones, including GIP or proglucagon, and thus have a considerable overlap with classically defined K and L cells, approximately half express Ghrl, suggesting a potentially important subset of duodenal EEC cells that require further consideration.

abstract = {Vacuum evaporation is an efficient method for reducing the volume of liquid digestate (LD) from biogas plants (BGP). Furthermore, thickening LD in BGP contributes to the efficient utilization of waste heat and also reduces fossil fuel consumption that is needed for transporting LD. However, the utilization of vacuum evaporation must be reasonable, and a comprehensive study should precede the integration of evaporation technology in a particular BGP. For this purpose, this study compares selected parameters of three types of industrial evaporators which may be suitable for LD thickening. Furthermore, this study provides a mathematical model that describes the mass and energy balances of the chosen evaporators and is able to evaluate their energy performance for a given set of input variables. It was concluded that the forced-circulation evaporator has the highest energy requirements and also requires a high cooling performance. This type of evaporator will be interesting for the plant owners only if the cost of power generation is extremely low. In terms of consumption of energy and cooling duty, the multi-stage flash evaporator is the most efficient and it also requires the least heat transfer area. The falling-film evaporator provides only slightly worse performance.},

Prior to this procedure, the magnesium–aluminum bimetallic hydroxides modified with sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (Mg/Al-SDBS-LDH) were prepared and served as the novel solid-phase extractant. The Mg/Al-SDBS-LDH has advantage of good hydrophobicity and larger spacing which facilitates the monoaromatic hydrocarbons (MAHCs) into the interlayer for adsorption. As a result, the seven MAHCs in 500 mL water samples were enriched greatly, and the theoretical enrichment factor reached to 125 times. Under the optimized conditions of solid-phase extraction (SPE) and GC–MS, the mass concentration of each MAHC (0.005–10, 0.01–10, or 0.05–10 ng/mL) had a fine linear relationship with peak area. The correlation coefficients were more than 0.995. The detection limits were between 0.001 and 0.01 ng/mL, and the RSD were between 3.1{\%} and 6.6{\%}. The method had been applied to determine the seven MAHCs in the Dongfengqu river water and laboratory wastewater of Chengdu University of Technology successfully.},

An optimization study was performed using ethanol as a solvent and with extraction pressure (5–10MPa), temperature (313–393K) and static extraction time (3–15min) as independent variables. The optimum PLE conditions for all response variables were estimated; however, PLE conditions resulting in the highest recovery of anthocyanins (5MPa, 553K and 9min of static extraction time) were chosen for comparison with a conventional low-pressure solvent extraction (LPSE). The attributes compared were yield, content of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds and economic feasibility. Similar extraction yields were obtained by LPSE and PLE under optimized conditions; however 2.15 and 1.66-fold more anthocyanins and total phenolic compounds, respectively, were extracted using PLE, while the cost of manufacturing (COM) obtained for the PLE extract was 40-fold lower.},

abstract = {Soybean meal has been intensively used as a substrate in culture media for several microorganisms. However, the fermentable sugar containing the soybean needs to be released from the solid matrix through different processes. Against this backdrop, the present study explores the use of high-energy ball milling as a one-step treatment method for expedited production of fermentable sugars of textured soybean. The best result is observed after only 5 min of milling, obtaining 34.1 times more fermentable sugars than untreated textured soybean, and 2.5 times more than commercially used soybean meal. Notably, the textured soybean ball-milled has been used as a substrate for Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki HD-73 fermentation. The cell and spore production is also compared with a standard Rowe media. The maximum cell concentration obtained in the entire fermentation process using ball-milled textured soybean media is found to be higher than the concentration obtained using the standard Rowe media. In addition, it is observed that there is a direct correlation between maximum cell production and reducing sugar concentration generated by the high-energy ball milling treatment. No fermentation inhibitors or by-products are generated during the physical treatment.},

@article{Sielfeld2019,
abstract = {This work studied the effect of pelletization on the SuperCritical (SC) carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) extraction yield of rosemary antioxidant fractions enriched in phenolic compounds. Dried rosemary leaves were depleted of essential oils by SC-CO 2 extraction and a portion of the resulting pre-extracted leaves (control substrate) enriched in phenolic compounds was pelletized. A factorial experimental design (2 3 ) was carried out: control substrate and pellets were extracted at two temperatures (40 and 70 °C), and two extraction pressures (30 and 50 MPa). Pelletizing decreased the extraction yield from 4.28{\%} to 1.33{\%}. However, the volumetric yield (mass of recovered solute per unit time and per unit volume of extraction bed) of pellets was 34{\%} higher than that of control substrate. Pelletization also decreased the antioxidant activity of the extracts, which was attributed to the high temperatures generated during the process. A linear correlation (R 2 = 0.83) between the antioxidant activity and the dominant rosemary phenolic carnosic acid was observed. Sovov{\'{a}}'s broken-and-intact cell model was applied to a selection of pellet and control substrate extraction curves to determine a microstructural factor (MF = D e /D 12 ) as best-fitting parameter. Resulting value of MF was 0.0003 for control substrate and 0.0027 for pellets. The simulation of the SC-CO 2 extraction of pellets with twice the specific surface showed that a decrease of particle size can increase considerably the extraction rate and yield of the pellets. We propose pelletization, under certain restrictions of particle size and process temperature, as a way of improving rosemary antioxidant extraction yield.},

Results indicated that UAE changed the above properties of FVPs. Compared with FVPH, higher yield, protein content, and uronic acid content but lower polysaccharide and polyphenol contents were observed in FVPU. UAE changed the surface microstructure, destroyed the triple helix structure, and increased the proportion of low molecular weight polysaccharide components of FVPU. Compared with FVPH, FVPU showed a stronger reducing power and scavenging activities on DPPH radical, hydroxyl radical, and superoxide anion radical. FVPU was a better inhibitor of inflammation compared with FVPH. However, FVPH had a better immunity enhancing effect compared with FVPU. These results were attributed to the cavitation effect of ultrasonic waves on the structure of polysaccharides during the extraction process of UAE. These findings suggested that UAE was an efficient and environmentally friendly method to produce new polysaccharides from F. velutipes for the development of functional foods or nutraceuticals.},

The phenolic compounds were also affected by the extraction temperature, influencing the antioxidant capacity of the gum. For all the extraction temperatures, SFG aqueous solutions showed a shear time-independent and shear-thinning behavior. Furthermore, oscillatory measurements showed a prevailing viscous character, but the decrease of the extraction temperature resulted in an increase of both G' and G".

abstract = {A pellet mill comprises a die which may rotatably be driven by a suitable drive. At least one press roller engages the inner surface of this die, and material to be pelleted is fed to this press roller by means of a deflector blade situated before. This deflector blade is arranged at least 45° before the related press roller--as seen in the direction of the rotation of the die--so that a free space of at least 45° will result therebetween. Within this free space, the centrifugal force due to the rotation of the die becomes effective and contributes to a better distribution of the material.},

abstract = {Sonochemistry is a very broad subject and nowadays it involves a wide range of disciplines and provides a forum for the cross-fertilization of ideas. In the early days this was not quite the situation and so a number of ideas that came forward were outside of main-line classical thinking in science. These concepts were often rejected out of hand and sometimes even ridiculed. This paper revisits some of these ideas for those of you who might be interested in the more unusual effects in sonochemistry.},

@article{Masche2019,
abstract = {This study assesses the changes in physical properties (particle size, shape, density) of Austrian pine (softwood) and European beech (hardwood), as they are mechanically processed from wood chips to pellets and then to milled pellets. A series of semi-industrial hammer mills and a semi-industrial pellet mill were used. The specific pelletizing and grinding energy, as well as the pellet mill and hammer mill capacity, were determined. Size, shape, and bulk density of the wood particles obtained at each processing step were studied. The pellet quality was analyzed according to international standards. Results show that the pelletization modifies the internal pellet particle shape and length due to the breakage of particles across their longest dimension, leading to more circular and less elongated particles. However, the particle width was nearly unaffected, indicating a directional fracture behavior for wood particles during pelletization. The particle breaking effect was more dominant for beech particles. Beech contained a lower amount of extractives than pine that led to higher specific pelletizing energy. In addition, beech pellets had a lower quality concerning durability and density. Relationships between specific grinding energies and characteristic product particle sizes were also determined. E.g., the specific energy for grinding pine pellets was about 10 kWh/t oven-dry wood for a characteristic product size of 0.8 mm, while grinding beech pellets required about 7 kWh/t oven-dry wood for a characteristic product size of 0.6 mm. The study concludes that less energy is needed to pelletize pine than beech under the same processing conditions, but more energy is needed to mill pine than beech.},

The mineralogical studies revealed the fine grain structure of sericite containing muscovite, orthoclase and phlogopite as the major potash bearing phases. The feed sample directly leached in different lixiviants yielded low potash dissolution values. Planetary ball milling was carried out to liberate the potash values from silicate matrix. Leaching was adopted to assess the liberated K values and within milling time of 10–12 h almost 90{\%} potash was leached out. Based on XRD analysis, orthoclase and phlogopite were found to be the toughest potash – bearing phase in terms of dissociation. Compared to other processes, mechanical activation process adopted in this work is simple, environment-friendly and minimal waste generation without using the chemical additive.},

@article{Marrugo2019,
abstract = {The effect of crude glycerol (G) on the pelletizing process and the quality of biomasses pellets were evaluated. Pellets were made of three types of agro-industrial biomasses typical of tropical countries: Sugarcane bagasse (SCB), Coffee Husk (CH) and Rice Husk (RH). Mixtures of water and glycerol were used as a binder. It was found that, with the addition of crude glycerin, the linkages between biomass particles for formation of pellets is made easier. However, this addition causes a reduction of the compaction degree since it acts as a lubricant between the biomass and the pelletization die, which produces the weakening of the solid to solid interaction. For CH and SCB particles, due to its shape and soft structure, pelletizing is not significantly affected by the biomass particle size variation, whereas in the case of small RH particles, the presence of a binder favors pelletizing. A brief dissertation about the aggregation mechanisms those were favored in each biomass type was carried out. A multi-criteria methodology was implemented by which it was possible to select the optimal conditions of pelletizing for each biomass.},
